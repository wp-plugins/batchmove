== Description ==
BatchMove is a WP plugin that make it possible to change the category where a post(s) belong to.
The main features are:

1. Assign the selected categories to posts.
1. Append the selected categories to posts.
1. Delete the selected categories from posts.
1. Operating manners which come up with people’s common practice.
1. Configurable number of posts listed in one page.
1. Enough searching and sorting options.
1. You are able to select a date range!
1. More in the future.

It is a rewrite of the plugin Rob Miller made, it now uses a class for its operations and all parts are separated.
You can Add, Update or Delete posts categories.
First you make a selection of the records you want to change, then choose new category and the action.
Thats all, send your request and the changes are made, the program send you direct to the choosen action category.

We have made BatchMove for WP users who are maintain large Wordpress
implementations.

The exact use is to move a lot of posts to an ohter category, for example
all post from news category who from for 1 january to archive
archive->2011 or category any name you want.
Or just what you want, the different is that this routine can update/add/delete
and not just add a post to a category.

It will also remove a category from a list of posts, also if a posts has
two or more categories where it belongs to.
So when a post belongs to news and information, it is possible to remove
only category news or information, but it also is possible in one action
to update it just to category achive (or whatever you want).
