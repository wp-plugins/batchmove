== Description ==
BatchMove is a WP plugin that make it possible to change the category where a post(s) belong to.
It is a rewrite of the plugin Rob Miller made, it now uses a class for its operations and all parts are separated.
You can Add, Update or Delete posts categories.
First you make a selection of the records you want to change, then choose new category and the action.
Thats all, send your request and the changes are made, the program send you direct to the choosen action category.

We have made BatchMove for WP users who are maintain large Wordpress
implementations.

The exact use is to move a lot of posts to an ohter category, for example
all post from news category who from for 1 january to archive
archive->2011 or category any name you want.
Or just what you want, the different is that this routine can update/add/delete
and not just add a post to a category.

Perhaps the best of this plugin, you are able to select a date range!

It will also remove a category from a list of posts, also if a posts has
two categories where it belongs to.
So when a post belongs to news and information, it is possible to remove
only category news or information, but it also is possible in one action
to update it just to category achive (or whatever you want).

Language files batch-move-en_EN.mo, batch-move-de_DE.mo, batch-move-nl_NL.mo now supported.
Options are in progress, like set a number of rows.
At the end of this development we complete this plugin to a realy useful archive solution.

If using this for the first time, don't forget to make a BACKUP before!
